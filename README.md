# Rothera-Long-Term-Winds
The code used in my current paper - Wind climatologies and inter-annual variability in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere over Rothera (67°S, 68°W) from radar observations and WACCM-X.
Includes data to make all figures and saved monthly mean values of wind from WACCM and the meteor radar. First pieces of code need original data.
